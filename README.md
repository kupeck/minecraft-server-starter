# This is my custom start.bat file
Feel free to use and modify (**not** distribute)

## Instructions

1. Copy both files to your minecraft server folder (both ending in .bat)

2. (Optional) If you want custom skript /shutdown and /reboot command, place the .sk file into your skripts folder (skript plugin requiered)\*

3. Open kupecks_setup.bat to setup your config

4. After you're done with that go into your spigot.yml file and chage line 16 to `  restart-script: kupecks_starter.bat`

5. (Optional) Now you can set it up so that kupecks_starter.bat starts with your computer

6. And you're done, now to start you server just open the kupecks_starter.bat file!\*\*

### Notes
\* To stop your server type /shutdown to restart type /reboot
\*\* To stop your server type /stop, to restart type /restart
There are some lines in the .sk skript in czech, by default they're disabled so you don't need to worry
